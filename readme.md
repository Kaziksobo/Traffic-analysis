# Traffic indicators on I-94

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway, and determine what factors can contribute to the traffic volume. For example, does heavy rain lead to heavier traffic? Does traffic get worse during the week or on weekends? These are the types of questions we will be exploring in this project.
